# IGLib.modules.IGLibScripting

IGLib basic scripting utilities (parsing, parametric commands, command-line interpreter).

**Important notice**: ***main* branch** is being changed **from *master* to *main***. For some time, both branches will be **kept in sync** because there are many dependencies on this repository. Expect that since **June '24** only the *main* branch may be kept, and *master* branch may be removed from the main repository.
