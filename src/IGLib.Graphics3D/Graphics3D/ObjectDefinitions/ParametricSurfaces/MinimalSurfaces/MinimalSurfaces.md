  * [Enneper surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneper_surface) (Wikipedia); [Enneper surface at MathCurve](https://mathcurve.com/surfaces.gb/enneper/enneper.shtml) contains parameterization of generalized Eneper surfaces (classic Enneper surface for n=2) that provide higher order symmetries (see [plots at Virtual Math Museum](), but parameterizations are not well described here).

A **minimal surface** is a surfaces **locally minimizes its area**. Minimal surfaces **have zero [mean curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_curvature)**. For a given closed single-cell wireframe, there is a unique surface that has the wireframe as its boundary and is a minimal surface (mean curvature zero). Such a surface is the surface with the smallest surface area of all continuous surfaces that have this wireframe as their boundary, and it can be physically constructed by creating a **soap surface spanning the wireframe** in zero gravitation and other field forces, due to surface tension (the minimal surface is the surface that minimizes the energy due to **surface tension**).
