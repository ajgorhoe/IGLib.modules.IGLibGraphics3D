# Library Plot3D.ActiVizOld

This is an experimental library that represents an attempt to use the old 3D plotting library that uses `ActiViz`, a .NET wrapper of .NET. A very old variant of `ActiViz` was used from the times when it was still an open source library, from 2011. Newer open source variants exist, but i could not find them on the internet.

If this can be made work successfully, I might try to also enable graphics with the newest variant of ActiViz, which is not open source, and I only have a limited time (60 days) trial version (otherwise I would need to buy a commercial license).
